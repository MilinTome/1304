Toronto Cup cake - things that can be done better
1)on the home page - not obvious where to click next to see what cupcakes they have. so it would need to
be more inviting
2) not sure why some have shading below them and others don't. so that would need to change
3)it would make more sense to have a list of cupcakes and when you click on one you get a visual
4)this bottom down approach seems cumbersome here, not sure that you need to scroll so far down .
5) menu bar should be along the top instead of hidden on the left hand side of the screem. 
6)i like pink but not necessary to highlght any color if it is along the top.
